# Controllable-Plane
OpenGL Interactive Visualization

This one is actually quite a bit simpler than the other visualizations I've done.  I was just following along with the learnopengl.com series, and at the end of one of the sections, I was inspired to modify the code to create a controllable plane to apply everything I had been learning.  There is no collision detection, but there are bounds to movement so the square cannot leave the screen.

Dependencies: GLFW, GLEW, glm, stb_image 

Video: Coming soon
